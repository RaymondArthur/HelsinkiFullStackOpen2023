To be honest, looking at the Networks tab in the browser's developer window... SPA looks the same as non-SPA when it comes to _initially_ loading the page.

It looks like there are still 5 HTTP requests on first load, but the SPA will differ when form data is sent after the page is first loaded.

I could recreate the diagram of the non-SPA page, but that seems like a waste of time since they'd be the same (I think)
